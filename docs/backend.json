    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to address the reported permission error and follow the core design principles of Authorization Independence, Clarity of Intent, DBAC (Database-Based Access Control), and QAPs (Rules are not Filters). The structure uses path-based ownership for user-specific data and denormalization where needed to avoid `get()` calls in security rules.\n\n**Authorization Independence:** The structure avoids hierarchical authorization dependencies by storing all data related to a user's account in a path that includes the user ID. Specifically, settings are stored under `/users/{userId}/settings/app-settings`, expenses are stored under `/users/{userId}/expenses/{expenseId}`, revenues are stored under `/users/{userId}/revenues/{revenueId}`, and appointments are stored under `/users/{userId}/appointments/{appointmentId}`. This eliminates the need to use `get()` calls to verify ownership of the documents, making the security rules more robust and efficient.\n\n**Clarity of Intent:** The paths clearly indicate the ownership and purpose of the data. For example, the path `/users/{userId}/expenses/{expenseId}` clearly indicates that the expense document is owned by the user identified by `{userId}`. The data structure also makes it clear where each type of data is stored, improving maintainability and debuggability.\n\n**DBAC (No Custom Claims):** The security rules rely solely on `request.auth.uid` to determine the user's identity. No custom claims are used. This approach simplifies the security rules and reduces the risk of errors.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):** The structure supports secure `list` operations by ensuring that all documents in a collection share the same security requirements. For example, a user can only list their own expenses, not the expenses of other users. This is achieved by storing each user's expenses in a separate collection under their user ID.\n\n**Error Resolution:** The reported permission error indicates that the user '5FJJv6raB0hDsi1cirAUcpNT3L92' did not have permission to `get` the document at `/databases/(default)/documents/users/5FJJv6raB0hDsi1cirAUcpNT3L92/settings/app-settings`. The proposed Firestore structure, combined with corresponding security rules, will ensure that users can only access their own settings and data, and not those of other users. The path `/users/{userId}/settings/app-settings` will allow the user, whose ID is {userId}, to get, update, and create their settings."
